DUE: In MarkUs, as soon as possible up until the assessment deadline but must be read and signed before you start working on the assessment. If not "signed" (Quest username, max 8 characters) below and submitted, the assessment grade will be zero. 

INSTRUCTIONS: Carefully read the following and then fill in your Quest username as the answer in the designated place below to indicate that you have read and agree to the declaration.

I declare the following statements to be true, effective from the release of the aforementioned assessment until its due date and time: 

* The work I submit here is entirely my own.

* I have not discussed and will not discuss the contents of this assessment with anyone, search the Internet for answers or share files related to the assessment with anyone until after the submission deadline. 
* I am aware that misconduct related to assessments can result in significant penalties, including, zero on the assessment, overall grade deduction and, depending on the significance of the assessment, failing the course and suspension (this is covered in Policy 71:
