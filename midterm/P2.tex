	The expected running time to search a key k should be $ \theta(n \log n)$
	
	To simplify the question, we can consider the keys for such BST are in $\{1,2,... ,n\}$
	
	For a BST, the average height is in $\Theta(\log n)$
	
	Since k can be arbitrary, if k is not in $\{1,2,... ,n\}$, then we probably reach the bottom of the tree.
	
	In this case, the running time for a search is $\Theta(\log n)$
	
	And since this kind of k's are infinitely many.
	
	Therefore, The expected running time to search for a key k should be $\theta(n \log n)$\\
	
	b)
	
	Considering a decision tree, there need to have at least $5! = 120$ leaves.
	
	So the tree need to have height at least 7, which means there is at least 7 comparisons.
